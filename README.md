Quora-Question Pair-Similarity 
Problem Statement:
-Identify which questions asked on Quora are duplicates of questions that have already 
been asked.

Domain: 
Social Networking
Real World/Business Objectives and Constraints:
-The cost of a mis-classification can be very high.
-You would want a probability of a pair of questions to be duplicates so that you can 
choose any threshold of choice.
-No strict latency concerns.
-Interpretability is partially important.


Techniques/Technologies Used In the Project:
In this project we are going to use the following Techniques:
o ML – Machine Learning
o NLP – Natural Language Processing
o MLOPs – Machine Learning Operations
    Experiment tracking with the help of MLFlow
    Workflow Orchestration 


Roadmap of the Project:

Phase - 1
Performing The Exploratory Data Analysis
Text Pre-Processing
Removing HTML tags.
Removing Punctuations.
Performing Stemming/ Lemmatization
Removing Stop words.
Expanding Contractions.
1. Apply Tokenization
2. Apply POS Tagging
3. Apply Label Encoding

Phase – 2
Numerical Vector Conversion
Word2vec
Feature Extraction
After doing Text Pre-Processing


Phase – 3 
 Data Pre-processing
• Separating the input variable and target variable.
• Training and Testing sets.
 Model Building
 Classification Algorithms:
• Logistic Regression
• Decision-tree
• SVM
• Random Forest
• XG Boost
• GBDT
 Evaluate the Model:
• Confusion Matrix
• Classification Report


Phase – 4
 Mlops
 Model Experiment Tracking with MLflow
 Automation using Workflow Orchestration - Prefect (OPTIONAL)
